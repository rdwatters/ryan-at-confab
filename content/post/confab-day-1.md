## Structured Content Across the Redesign Process

[**Lisa Maria Martin, Independent IA/CS Consultant**](http://confabevents.com/events/central-2017/lisa-maria-martin)

Focus on *what* you are trying to measure:

* Quality
* Quantity
* Structure
* Presentation
    * Good, for example, with pattern libraries
* Usability
    * Ease of access
    * Ease of use
    * Interactivity
    * "What is getting in the way of users getting what they want?"

Start with a clean, easy-to-intuit template. Content audit spreadsheets, thousands of page entries, etc; these are *not* deliverables.

### Organizing Content

* Sitemaps are still one of the best visualizations, but...
    * They don't show how pages connect
    * Don't show taxonomies
* Sitemaps can be part of the basis of your strategy, but they should not be one size fits all. Don't generalize structure and then shoehorn content into it.
* Structure needs to be purposeful since it's the basis of our end user's mental model.

#### What is Guiding Your Strategy?

* Strategy Documents
* Concepts
* Design principles

### Content Products

*Content products* are looser versions of content types. More general; as in, what are we generally trying to build and convey here? Build relationships, not just categories.

We focus too much on taxonomies being tags and categories rather than a representation of relationships between content. Well-structured taxonomies are imperative for a good user experience.

### Content Analysis Tools

Automated content analysis software out there. Some are more focused on URLs, some on images, automated call data, volume and distribution, etc, so it's important to decide exactly what you want to measure before deciding on software.

* [CAT, content analysis tool](http://www.content-insight.com/products)
* [BoardThing](https://boardthing.com/)
* [Treejack](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/treejack)
    * Information architecture validation software
* Microsoft Excel
    * "learn the magic of pivot tables"

## Content Design: What It is and How to Do It

[**Meghan Casey, Lead Content Strategist, Brain Traffic**](http://confabevents.com/events/central-2017/meghan-casey)

### What is content design?

Content design already *assumes a content strategy*. The main question is:

"Are you aligned on intent?"

> I can organize the shit out of anything, but I haven't quite figured out the best way to decide what is important and what isn't.

1. Content prioritization
2. Content organization, label, grouping
3. Content presentation; how does it come together in different pages so that users can find value and meeting in that content
4. Content specification; alignment with stakeholders, and what specific content you need to execute strategy.

#### Content Organization

How to label and group content so that users can find it. There are tools you can use for this process:

* 1. Topic map
    * Very high level, can include things like global navigation
    * Phases of a user's interactions and how they map back to areas of the website
    * Helps get initial alignment
* 2. Relationship Model
    * Demonstrates relationships between content and other factors

### Key Concept: Content Wireframes

Content wireframes (compare to Jeff Eaton's [annotated wireframes](/post/confab-workshop-eaton/#bonus-annotated-wireframes)):

* Inform the eventual visual design
* Prioritizes content, shows objectives,
* Can act as a governance document and promote alignment with stakeholders/business units

> Taxonomy is the only way to auto-magically get content together and to define *relationships* between content.
