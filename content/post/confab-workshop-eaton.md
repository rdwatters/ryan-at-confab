## Introduction

> No one document can describe your content completely.

> No one team has all the answers about your content.

> Collaboration uses everyone's work to make a better content model.

### Starting a Content Model

* Territory: Who owns this?
    * Who gets to say what the content model is?
* Language: Can we all understand it?
    * W/territory resolved, do we have a shared vocabulary we can use to talk about this stuff?
* Entropy: Is it up to date?
    * Even the content model needs to be regularly updated, along with the content itself

Jorge Luis Borges, magical realist, about an empire that perfected cartography.

> In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of that Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars... - *On Exactitude in Science*, by Jorge Luis Borges

*Maps show important things and not ALL the things.* A [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract) is more complicated than anything that's been represented by a single representation, but the single representation are important because they help us create a *mental model*.

Not...

> Which model is the real one?

But instead...

> Which angle are we looking at?

> The purpose of content modeling is **shared understanding* and clear, **consistent answers** to content questions from **all teams**.

### Questions to Ask for Content Modeling

**1.** What distinct kinds of content do we create and manage, what are their unique purposes, and how do they **relate** to each other?
**2.** What **individual properties** make up each piece of content? What **rules* govern them, and **where do they come from**?
**3.** How is the content **organized** behind the scenes, and to our customers? Even something as simple as "tags" are a deep part of the content's purpose and relationships, both internally for those who consume it.
**4.** What **processes** does the content go through as it's developed, published, promoted, and maintained?
**5.** What **people** and **roles** are responsible for the content throughout its **lifecycle**?
**6.** What **goals** are we trying to accomplish with the content, and what things are **measuring** to track our **progress**? As in, "Why do we actually make this stuff?" For example, measuring your bounce rate is likely a waste of time unless you're a purely ad-revenue-drive startup.

## Group Exercise: Welcome to Picnictown, Collaborative Content Modeling: The Game

* North American Association of Picnickers
* Promotes "outdoor eating with family and friends"
* Covers classic picnicking, cookouts, tailgating
* Founded in 1968, funded by retail food industry
* CEO is Fred. Hates the color red.
* Not real.
* Early 2000s CEO loved poems

Keep an eye out for the following...

* Whose perspective does this artifact represent?
* Where does it overlap with other artifacts?
* Are we using different words for the same thing?
* Does it reveal oversight in other artifacts?
* Should we revisit another artifact to reflect what we've discovered?

### My Role

* "CMS Developer"
    * You've been told about a "redesign," so it's your job to make sure the CMS actually does the cool things everyone is talking about...

### Company Info and Demographics

* 35 and up
    * Lots of free time, family oriented
    * Current thinking is that "Millenials are destroying picnics"; they keep having picnics on their own without visiting the NAAP website
* Strong representation of 24-36, but only at tailgating
* Travel journal before; didn't really take off
* Partners in retail food industry work with NAAP to promote deals, etc during specific seasons
* We are on Facebook and Instagram
* Who are our competitors?
    * Another group has been brought in for competitive analysis
* Any advocacy for specific types of picnickers?
    * One of the directors is a vegetarian
* Authentication/personalization:
    * Used to have a photo gallery that people could contribute to
    * No user-generated reviews; "we like to think of ourselves as a trusted expert in the picnicking realm"
* Had discussions about developing relationships with parks
* Used to have *Picnickers Monthly* print magazine in the 80s
* Content creation capabilities
    * 3, used to have 4
    * 2 picnicking SMEs; do research and product evaluation
    * 2 full-time cooks on staff
* Are there any NAAP products, tshirts, baskets, etc?

### Group Feedback Content Types

* Recipe
* Articles
    * Blog Posts
    * Tips from Experts
    * Product Reviews
    * Featured Picnickers and Picnic Ambassadors/Influencers
    * Poems
* Person/Profile
* Products
* Events
    * Location
* Promos (different than coupons?)
* Community
    * Partners/Brands
    * Forum
* Media
    * Photos
    * Videos
    * Podcasts
* "Resources"
    * Organizational Info
* Advertisements

**Conf:** How do we feel about picnics that accompany live events?
**JE:** We love them; we cross-promote as much as possible.

### Entity Relationship Diagrams

* Types of content
* Clusters and groups
* Explicit Relationships

Lines and circles in lines called "Crow's foot notation" for the modeling. See [wikipedia entry on crow's foot notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model).

#### Entity Relationship Exercise

* 10 minutes
* Shout out ideas
* At each table
    * Group, organize, connect
    * Combine, rename, eliminate

#### Entity Relationship Exercise Results

* How much does the CMS handle automatically?
* How much of each exists, and how much will we make?
* Has usage or purpose changed over time?
* Will it be translated into other languages?
* Does it make sense to all team members?

**Conf:** Does accessibility come into play at this point in the project?
**JE:** Comes in more during the design stage, especially when it comes to media.

### Persona

* Representative Individuals
* A name and role
* Goals and desires
* Frustrations and distractions
    * List of things they hate about tech, websites, apps, etc.
    * How do they consume the content? (e.g., via podcast while driving, so they're always distracted)
* ...season to taste

### Persona Exercise

Group feedback:

1. Pauline the Parent
2. Dawn the DINK (dual income, no kids)
3. Chris the Coed
4. Olive the Outdoorswoman
5. George the Geriatric
6. Eve the Event Planner
7. Charlene the Chef
8. Victor the Visitor

### Persona Exercise (Table)

* Pauline the Parent
    * Description
        * At least employee
        * Married
        * Family organizer
    * Motivations
        * Create meaningful family time
        * Reducing screen time and promoting activity with her kids
        * Motivated by her children's interests (what's fun for her kids)
        * Shopping list
    * Goals
        * Simple recipes
        * Tips for cooking for kids without heavy copy
        * Locations (e.g., kid friendly activities nearby)
    * Frustrations
        * In other web properties:
            * Harder to find family-friendly recipes
            * Harder to find healthy, kid-friendly options
            * Recipes are geared towards "foodies"
* Tom the Tailgater (Ran out of time)
    * Description
    * Motivations
    * Goals
    * Frustrations

Do different personas...

* Want or need different content?
* Find or access content differently?
* Have special accessibility needs?
* Create their own content, or have access to more?

## Bonus: Dual-Axis Sorting!

* Based on "delphi sorting method"
* Two conflicting values
* A lot of items
* A pile of post-its
* 20-30 minutes

One person goes in and organizes the architecture. Take a photo. Next person comes in and reorganizes it. Take a photo. Helps to identify the areas that tend to be moved the most, certain "hot spots" that are especially contentious. You can then map out the post-it notes on a chart with a Y axis of "Business Value" and an X axis of "User Interest."

## Bonus: Annotated Wireframes

* Key content elements
* Priority, emphasis, connection
* Rough sketch, not aesthetics
* Notes on purpose/meaning

### Annotated Wireframe

The difference between low-fi wireframes and annotated wireframes is the latter contains *notes* explaining different areas of the layout.

## Data Dictionaries

It's important to have coordination between the content strategy team and strong developers who are able to keep database tables, data types, etc up to date.

What to include in a data dictionary:

* A separate spreadsheet page for each distinct type of content
* Names and descriptions for every field, property, or piece of metadata on the content type
* Type of data stored in each field, and any special requirements unique to the field
* Special validation or data entry requirements for each field (*required for publishing, supports multiple values, default values, etc*)
* Additional project-specific notes, like where a field's information will come from in a content migration

Questions to ask for data dictionaries:

* Do any of our content types share the same properties, fields, and metadata? Is it possibly to consolidate them?
* Is there data in our existing content that conflicts with the requirements we've discovered or defined?
* Does our content include data with unique storage or hosting requirements? (*YouTube video links vs. large local video files, product information stored in separate CMSs, etc.*)

**Conf:** Our event content type also had a location attribute. Should that be its own content type?
**JE:** The answer is "it depends."

## User Journeys and User Journey Maps

* One persona
* Their interactions with a product over time
* The content/messages they encounter

### User Journey Map Exercise

* At each table
    * Pick one persona and one need
    * What stages would they go through?
    * What content do they encounter?
    * Where do they see it?

## Q&A

**Conf:** Think of content model in relation to content model?
**JE:** I see the CMS and content model at opposite ends of the spectrum. CMS-specific details come in later on when you have to decide the middle ground between the platonic form of the content model and the abilities of the technology you're going to use. [Story about *This Old House* and the shift to an all-gallery website and how that is *not* the content model but rather how a particular *CMS* houses the content.]

## Quotes

> Collaboration uses everyone's work to make a better model.

> Sometimes the distinction between "content type" and "taxonomy" are arbitrary.

> Work in nonprofits has shown me there is this weird tension between the people that are actually interested in coming to the site and the donors or financial interests behind the site.

> What we see in nonprofits and NGOs is that they really, really, really desperately want to organize their website according to their sponsors or the way the organization is structured internally.
