### Key Takeaways

Not a whole lot to say here other than the following:

* Levar Burton is really inspiring
* I kind of want to be Levar Burton
* Kids need to read more
* Mothers need to read to their children
* Adults need to read more
* Our current POTUS is, quite clearly, *not* a reader

## Coaching Success: Training Strategies for Building Strong Teams

* When we watch people use a site, and they're able to do more because of better IA, design, etc, we feel much better about our product.
* Then a few months pass, and our previously pretty site is now a bit ragged:
    * Messaging goes downhill
    * Sloppy text
    * Site becomes more difficult to use
* Realization: people are maintaining the site
    * Using a module the way it was used in a previous system
    * Not fully leveraging the tools provided to them with the new system and site

### Personal Growth

If I can't change other people, what does that mean for how I teach people? Isn't teaching, by definition, a matter of trying to change people?

* Traditional trainings don't work because they don't account for variations in learning style, telecommuting vs in-house, etc.

People are getting better and better at focusing information on the user's needs and making things easier w/r/t content and information.

> We are in the golden age of user experience.
